For all those things I didn’t have enough time:

-Check if changing the screen orientation is handled correctly
-Write javadoc
-Search for memory leaks
-Implementing Tests
-Checking If Internet Connection is available and only then make requests
-Handling status different from HTTP_OK

For all other issues look into the source code. I have marked import things I would improve by „FIXME“ annotations
